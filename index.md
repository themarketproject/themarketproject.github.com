        <p class="problem">
          Nobel Prize winning economist Amartra Sen called poverty "the problem of lacking autonomy and freedom." And too often, poverty goes hand-in-hand with human trafficking, trauma and exploitation. Charitable outreaches often meet critical immediate needs, but we seek to build real economic opportunity by starting businesses.

      <h2>About The Market Project</h2>

      <!-- <p>We come alongside existing aftercare organizations and provide training and work for aftercare participants. By doing so, we equip the participants with transferrable skills and business opportunities that extend beyond their time in aftercare and enable the aftercare organizations to focus on the critical work of care and counseling.</p> -->

      <p>We long to see men and women restored and set free through creative work and business ownership.</p>

      <p>As we strive to make that a reality, we partner with trafficking and trauma aftercare organizations to provide training and support to enable their participants to establish their own business.</p>

      <p>Our values guide our internal conduct as well as our relationship with the external world. At The Market Project we value:</p>

            <p><strong>Strengthening Aftercare.</strong> We want to partner with organizations who are actively improving the quality of their counseling and care. By assuming responsibly for enterprise training and technical assistance, we free our partners to provide the best quality of counseling and care.</p>
            <p><strong>Ongoing Prevention.</strong> We expect that businesses will bring enduring stability to their communities, spreading beyond the rescued and offering wider employment opportunities for others who might otherwise be vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation.</p>

          <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p><strong>Market Driven Products.</strong> Our products must have robust market potential independent of the backstory of the people who create them. This forces us to do the hard work of product development on the front end but creates the greatest opportunity for success during and after a participant’s time in aftercare.</p>
            <p><strong>Safe and Creative Work.</strong> We focus on products that emphasize creativity and can be completed in a safe workplace. This commitment to safety will be the exception in many places where we work, but we believe it will both enhance the healing process for the participants and help to raise overall standards for employment where we work.</p>
