    <h2>The Market Project partners with organizations caring for men and women rescued out of trafficking and trauma situations around the world. </h2>
    <p>We come alongside existing aftercare organizations and provide training and work for aftercare participants. By doing so, we equip the participants with transferrable skills and business opportunities that extend beyond their 0me in aftercare and enable the aftercare organizations to focus on the critical work of care and counseling.</p>

            <p><strong>Strengthening Aftercare.</strong> We want to partner with organizations who are actively improving the quality of their counseling and care. By assuming responsibly for enterprise training and technical assistance, we free our partners to provide the best quality of counseling and care.</p>
            <p><strong>Ongoing Prevention.</strong> We expect that businesses will bring enduring stability to their communities, spreading beyond the rescued and offering wider employment opportunities for others who might otherwise be vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation.</p>

          <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p><strong>Market Driven Products.</strong> Our products must have robust market potential independent of the backstory of the people who create them. This forces us to do the hard work of product development on the front end but creates the greatest opportunity for success during and after a participantâ€™s time in aftercare.</p>
            <p><strong>Safe and Creative Work.</strong> We focus on products that emphasize creativity and can be completed in a safe workplace. This commitment to safety will be the exception in many places where we work, but we believe it will both enhance the healing process for the participants and help to raise overall standards for employment where we work.</p>
