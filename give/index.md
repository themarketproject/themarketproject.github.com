<div class="row">
<div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns">

<p>Endemic poverty stifles creativity and crushes the spirit. And men and women around the globe simply want to provide for themselves and their families. At The Market Project, we long to see those rescued out of trauma, trafficking and exploitation restored and set free through creative work and business ownership. The Market Project restores dignity as we partner with trafficking and trauma aftercare organizations to provide training and support that enables participants to start afresh.</p>

<p>And to have such an impact, we need your help. We are seeking financial partners like you - those willing to provide one-time or ongoing support to help us accomplish this important work. Please join us. Write your check, payable to CVI* with "The Market Project" in the memo and mail to:</p>

<p>In addition to financial partners, The Market Project will have an ongoing need for entrepreneurs, product designers and business assistance. If you are interested in volunteering your time to consult on current and future projects, email us today and we will contact you as projects evolve.</p>
